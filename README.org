* Emacs Configuration
This emacs configuration uses the package "use-package" to install and configure additional packages. General packages used are auto-complete and ivy.
The major modes heavily customized is org-mode.
Org-Mode uses org-ref as it's citation/bibliography manager.
Python modes are also included in the configuration but mostly commented out since there exists bugs in the way I would like to run python in Emacs.
AUCTeX is used as the backend to edit LaTeX files.
* Installation
Clone the git repository on GitHub (https://github.com/jchkoch/.emacs.d.git).
Modify all user specified file paths in the file "config.org".
If not modified, Emacs may not load the configuration file properly.
