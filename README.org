* Emacs Configuration

This emacs configuration uses the package "use-package" to install and configure additional packages. General packages used are:

     - auto-complete
     - IDO
     - smex

Org-Mode and Python are other major modes customized. 
Org-Mode uses org-ref as it's citation/bibliography manager.
Python uses Elpy to customize a integrated development environment.
AUCTeX is used as the backend to edit LaTeX files.
