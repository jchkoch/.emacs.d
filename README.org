* Emacs Configuration
This emacs configuration uses the package "use-package" to install and configure additional packages. General packages used are auto-complete and ivy.
The major modes heavily customized is org-mode.
Org-Mode uses org-ref as it's citation/bibliography manager.
Python mode uses elpy and ob-ipython to customize python functionality in python files and in org babel source blocks in org-mode.
Ob-ipython uses additional functions from John Kitchin's scimax as a workaround to fix existing bugs in ob-ipython.
* Installation
Clone the git repository on GitHub (https://github.com/jchkoch/.emacs.d.git).
Modify all user specified file paths in the file "config.org".
If not modified, Emacs may not load the configuration file properly.
