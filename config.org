** DONE What is this
This document contains the majority of my configurations for GNU Emacs and is known in this document as ~config.org~.
It is designed using the principle of "literate programming" which combines the written language and inline code blocks.
Emacs knows how to only evaluate the ~elisp~ (Emacs Lisp) code included herein while the written language is for humans to better understand the code and the underlying rationale of the developer.

Literate programming has the advantage of being more deliberate and explanatory than terse ~elisp~ scripts.
This makes it useful for the purposes of sharing knowledge to all users of varying level of experience.
This document itself is written in ~org-mode~ and contains all /package configurations/ for my Emacs setup.
** DONE How to use this document
This document assumes that a user has a basic familiarity with ~Emacs~ and specifically ~org-mode~.
However, both novice and experienced users of ~Emacs~ should be able to find beneficial and practical uses of the present document.
As with all things ~Emacs~, the user is encouraged to customise their configuration to suit their purposes.
Therefore, it is encouraged that the user picks and chooses the ~elisp~ code presented herein which most appeals to them, discarding the rest which does not suit them.
This document and relevant additional files are available in a version controlled git repository for all to load into ~Emacs~.
** DONE Where I run Emacs
My OS of choice is openSUSE Leap distribution of GNU/Linux.
My Emacs is pre-packaged from my operating system.
I decided to utilize the distribution provided Emacs package for the stability that is associated with not tracking the bleeding edge version contained in the Emacs source repository.
I am not a software developer but engineer and it is important to me to have tools which consistently and reliably work.

Full cross-platform compatibility and portability is *not* guaranteed by my configuration.
I do, nonetheless, try to provide comments and suggestions for alternatives when needed to account for differences when using other operating systems.
** DONE Note about my methodology
My methodology is such that new configurations and packages only make their way into this document after maturing (if they are still present) in my own workflow for a few months.
The specific timing can vary drastically depending on the number of new things I discover in Emacs at any given time and how busy I am with other work.
Nonetheless, I try to keep this document (and thus my configuration) up to date with recent trends in Emacs possibilities and workflows from a variety of sources mostly more experienced Emacs users.
** DONE Sources of Emacs wisdom
Many of the configurations within this document are inspired or taken from other (more experienced) users of Emacs who have also shared their own dotemacs configurations.
I use ~use-package~ developed by [[http://www.newartisans.com][John Wiegley]] ([[https://github.com/jwiegley/dot-emacs/][=jwiegley= dotemacs]]) to configure all my other packages used herein.
A significant majority of the configurations within this document are based on the configurations of [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Bernt Hansen]], [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:9ff13b78-42b8-49fe-9e23-0307c780de93][Protesilaous Stavrou]], [[http://kitchingroup.cheme.cmu.edu/][John Kitchin]], and [[https://github.com/gregsexton][Greg Sexton]].
Many thanks to them for their incredible work!

* DONE Base settings
** DONE Always rebuild init
When Emacs expands this ~org-mode~ file into the actual ~elisp~ code, it tangles (i.e. combines) all the code blocks from ~config.org~ into a new file ~config.el~.
Emacs then loads this new file when launched with the customisations in the state when this new file, ~config.el~, was written.
Any updates requires a rewrite of ~config.el~.
Thus, to ensure older settings are not loaded, the derived file is deleted when I instruct Emacs to terminate its process.
Thereby ensuring that at the next launch of Emacs, new customisations are parsed and included as a part of my configuration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :config
    (defun jk/delete-emacs-init ()
      (interactive)
      (let ((configs "~/.emacs.d/config.el"))
        (when configs
          (delete-file configs))))
    :hook (kill-emacs . jk/delete-emacs-init))
#+end_src

** DONE Edit modeline names
In Emacs, depending on what type of file you visit or special buffers different modes may be active.
The name of the modes, active in any buffer, are shown on the modeline.
It is often convenient to alter the mode name shown to simplify the information presented on the modeline itself.

With this package, we can easily edit or rename the mode names (even altogether hiding the mode name) on the modeline.
Any package declaration with ~use-package~ that uses the ~:delight~ keyword will rename what appears on the modeline should that package be active for any current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package delight
    :ensure t
    :after use-package)
#+end_src

** DONE Custom.el
When you install a package or use various customisation interfaces to adjust values to suit your needs, Emacs will append a piece of ~elisp~ code to your init file.
To maintain a clean and organized configuration, I prefer to have these automatically included pieces of ~elisp~ code to be contained in a separate file.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package cus-edit
    :config
    (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")

    (unelss (file-exists-p custom-file)
            (write-region "" nil custom-file))

    (load custom-file))
#+end_src

* TODO General interface and interactions
This section contains configurations for aspects of the Emacs user interface.
** DONE Disable GUI components
Since I normally use the GUI variant of Emacs, I prefer not to have any of the GUI elements that come with it out-of-the-box.
The only element which remains is the modeline which, of course, is not part of the GUI anyway...
Additionally, the pair of keybindings to minimise and suspend the frame are disabled since I rarely minimise applications instead relying heavily on virtual desktops instead.
A last note is that I disable the "hello file" function because it seems to be very slow to open in Emacs on my GNU/Linux system.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :init
    (menu-bar-mode -1)
    (tool-bar-mode -1)
    (scroll-bar-mode -1)
    (tooltip-mode -1)
    :config
    (setq use-file-dialog nil)
    (setq use-dialog-box t)         ; only for mouse events
    (setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
    (global-unset-key (kbd "C-z"))
    (global-unset-key (kbd "C-x C-z"))
    (global-unset-key (kbd "C-h h")))
#+end_src

** DONE Visual line mode is a must
By default, Emacs displays text one line at a time.
If you are writing prose and the text scrolls off your screen as may happen if you use literate programming, then it pays off to use a visual (human readable) line mode where sentences wrap to the "next" line if your sentence is too long.
In my workflow, there are very few cases when I need to disable this type of visual line mode and so I have chosen to make this the default.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :config
    (setq-default global-visual-line-mode t))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: t
** DONE Themes that I use
I tend to switch themes occasionally and so I make it as easy as possible for myself to do so.
At the moment, I have switched to using the ~modus-vivendi~ theme developed by [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:9ff13b78-42b8-49fe-9e23-0307c780de93][Protesilaous Stavrou]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :config
    (setq custom-safe-themes t)
    (set-default 'cursor-type 'bar)

    (load-theme 'modus-vivendi t))

  (use-package modus-vivendi-theme
    :ensure t
    :defer t)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

*** DONE Mode line
The mode line is a fundamentally integral part of the Emacs interface.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :config
    (setq mode-line-percent-position '(-3 "%p"))
    (setq mode-line-defining-kbd-macro
          (propertize " Macro" 'face 'mode-line-emphasis))
    (setq-default mode-line-format
                  '("%e"
                    mode-line-front-space
                    mode-line-mule-info
                    mode-line-client
                    mode-line-modified
                    mode-line-remote
                    mode-line-frame-identification
                    mode-line-buffer-indentification
                    "  "
                    mode-line-position
                    " "
                    mode-line-modes
                    " "
                    mode-line-misc-info
                    mode-line-end-spaces)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t

**** DONE Battery status
As my primary computer where I use Emacs is a laptop, it is convenient to include the battery status in the mode line. The following code is attributed to [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:9ff13b78-42b8-49fe-9e23-0307c780de93][Protesilaous Stavrou]] who writes:

#+begin_quote
   Emacs offers a built-in library for presenting information about the status of the laptop's battery. Using it allows me to eliminate my dependence on the system panel and thus keep Emacs in full screen view without any interruptions.

   The default update interval is set to a single minute (in seconds), which is generally fine though I find that a slightly higher value works just as well. As for the format, it is designed to show a context-dependent, single character indicator about the current status, as well as the battery's overall percentage.

   Variable battery-mode-line-limit will hide the indicator if the value is above the declared threshold. 99 basically means "full". I use that instead of a 100 because sometimes the battery only ever fills up to 99.99, meaning that the indicator remains present at all times.
#+end_quote


#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package battery
    :config
    (setq battery-mode-line-format " [%b%p%%]")
    (setq battery-mode-line-limit 99)
    (setq battery-update-interval 180)
    (setq battery-load-low 20)
    (setq battery-load-critical 10)
    :init ((after-init . display-battery-mode)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t

**** DONE Display the current time
Adjust the format of how the current time of day is displayed on the mode line.
I use the 24h clock and like to also know the date.
For the date I use the typical European format of "%Y-%M-%D".

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package time
    :config
    (setq display-time-format "%Y-%M-%D  %H:%M")
    ;;;; Covered by `display-time-format'
    ;; (setq display-time-24hr-format t)
    ;; (setq display-time-day-and-date t)
    (setq display-time-interval 60)
    (setq display-time-mail-directory nil)
    (setq display-time-default-load-average nil)
    :hook ((after-init . display-time-mode)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

**** DONE Keycast mode
To quote [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:9ff13b78-42b8-49fe-9e23-0307c780de93][Protesilaous Stavrou]]:

#+begin_quote
  Once enabled, this package uses the mode line to show the keys being pressed and the command they call. It is quite useful for screen casting.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package moody
    :ensure t)

  (use-package keycast
    :ensure t
    :after moody
    :commands keycast-mode
    :config
    (setq keycast-window-predicate 'moody-window-active-p)
    (setq keycast-separator-width 1)
    (setq keycast-insert-after 'mode-line-end-spaces)
    (setq keycast-remove-tail-elements nil))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t

*** DONE Fringe mode
The fringe areas are to the right and left side of the Emacs frame. As [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:9ff13b78-42b8-49fe-9e23-0307c780de93][Protesilaous Stavrou]] explains:

#+begin_quote
  They can be used to show status-related or contextual feedback such as line truncation indicators, continuation lines, code linting markers, etc.
#+end_quote

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package fringe
    :config
    (fringe-mode '(8 . 8))                          ; pixels
    (setq-default fringes-outside-margins nil)
    (setq-default indicate-buffer-boundaries nil)
    (setq-default indicate-empty-lines nil)
    (setq-default overflow-newline-into-fringe t))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: t

*** DONE Diff highlights in the left fringe
The ~diff-hl~ package uses either fringe area to display changes in the current buffer if the file in the buffer is under version control.
This is a new package to me so I am still experimenting with it.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package diff-hl
    :ensure t
    :config
    (setq diff-hl-draw-borders nil)
    (setq diff-hl-side 'left)
   :hook ((after-init . global-diff-hl-mode)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

*** DONE Toggle for line numbers and whitespace indicators
1. Display line numbers
   For the most part, I do not use these manual toggle very often; however, there are occasions where I want line numbers in a mode which I do not by default add line numbers.
   For these cases, I have these function to toggle line numbers on for a local buffer.
2. Display invisible characters (whitespace)
   Viewing whitespace is sometimes helpful to debug prose which is exported via \LaTeX to PDF documents or web pages.
   Mostly, this is kept inactive.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package emacs
    :config
    (defun jk/toggle-invisibles ()
      "Toggles the display of indentation and space characters."
      (interactive)
      (if (bound-and-true-p whitespace-mode)
          (whitespace-mode -1)
        (whitespace-mode)))

    (defun jk/toggle-line-numbers ()
      "Toggles the display of line numbers.  Applies to all buffers."
      (interactive)
      (if (bound-and-true-p display-line-numbers-mode)
          (display-line-numbers-mode -1)
        (display-line-numbers-mode)))

    :bind (("<f6>" . jk/toggle-invisibles)
           ("<f7>" . jk/toggle-line-numbers)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

** TODO Language settings for prose and code
*** DONE Recognize sub-words

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package subword
    :delight
    :commands subword-mode
    :init ((prog-mode-hook . subword-mode)))
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
*** DONE Flyspell (spell check)
I need spell checking for both English and German. Enable Flyspell Mode.
If you keep your spell check personal dictionary in particular location, change this variable as desired.
Some of this configuration is taken from Joel Kuiper (https://joelkuiper.eu/spellcheck_emacs) and some more from [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:9ff13b78-42b8-49fe-9e23-0307c780de93][Protesilaous Stavrou]] including a user-defined function to easily switch using different dictionaries for different languages.

Note: Using =aspell= as the dictionary will not work on Windows anymore as there is no windows binary which works with Emacs 26.1 and greater, therefore best practice is to switch to using =hunspell=.
See link on how to do this for Windows [[https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnu-emacs/2014-04/msg00030.html][here]] and for Linux simply go to your distribution and install it there.
On GNU/Linux most likely you need to download extra dictionaries from [[https://github.com/wooorm/dictionaries][this link]] like for the German language.

*** DONE Tabs, indentation, and the TAB key
As I fan of the Python programming language as well as Emacs, I believe strongly in tabs (i.e. in the sense of the tab character) when dealing with text files and indenting code.
However, as [[https://protesilaos.com/dotemacs/#h:9ff13b78-42b8-49fe-9e23-0307c780de93][Protesilaous Stavrou]] notes:

#+begin_quote
  ..., I understand that elisp uses its own approach, which I do not want to interfere with. Also, Emacs tends to perform alignments by mixing tabs with spaces, which can actually lead to misalignments depending on certain variables such as the size of the tab. As such, I am disabling tabs by default.

  If there ever is a need to use different settings in other modes, we can customise them via hooks. This is not an issue I have encountered yet and am therefore refraining from solving a problem that does not affect me.

** NEXT Registers
** DONE Scrolling behaviour
#+begin_quote
   Page scrolling should keep the point at the same visual position, rather than force it to the top or bottom of the viewport. This eliminates the friction of guessing where the point has warped to.

   As for per-line scrolling, I dislike the default behaviour of visually re-centring the point. With the following, it will stay at the top/bottom of the screen while moving in that direction (use C-l to reposition it). This does not result in more manual interventions to recenter text, because of the above.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Ivy is an interactive interface for completion in Emacs. Emacs uses completion mechanism in a variety of contexts: code, menus, commands, variables, functions, etc. Completion entails listing, sorting, filtering, previewing, and applying actions on selected items. When active, ivy-mode completes the selection process by narrowing available choices while previewing in the minibuffer. Selecting the final candidate is either through simple keyboard character inputs or through powerful regular expressions.

*** Capturing
When a new task occurs and needs to be added, org-capture allows me to easily capture it.
I categorize it into a few new groups that I use as templates:
+ A new task (t)
+ A meeting (m)
+ A email I need to respond to (e)
+ A phone call (p)
+ A new note (n)
+ A interruption (i)
+ A new habit (h)
+ A org protocol (w)

*** Refiling
Set a global ``refile`` org file as a staging area for new TODO items and basic settings to make refiling tasks easier. The code is based on the configuration in this [[https://blog.aaronbieber.com/2017/03/19/organizing-notes-with-refile.html][article]].

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-default-notes-file "/winc/jk/myLife/refile.org")

  ; Include targets up to 9 levels deep
  (setq org-refile-targets (quote ((nil :maxlevel . 9)
                                   (org-agenda-files :maxlevel . 9))))

  ; Allow refile to create parent tasks with confirmation
  (setq org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes (quote confirm))

  ; Exclude DONE state tasks from refile targets
  (defun bh/verify-refile-target ()
    "Exclude todo keywords with a done state from refile targets"
    (not (member (nth 2 (org-heading-components)) org-done-keywords)))
